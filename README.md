PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Genetic algorithms are generally stochastic and are used to solve the maximization problems. In the implementation of genetic algorithms, chromosomes with the highest fitness are likely to survive in such a way that the fittest generation arrives at the end. We are solving the knapsack problem in which there is a set of distinct items with random weight and value, and the knapsack has the fixed weight. Our goal is to design a game in which we are measuring the top scorer by typing words. 

 The number of words typed that yields the highest number of points within the given time will be the added to the knapsack without exceeding the weight(capacity of knapsack-time in the defined use case).

 In the following table, points obtained by typing the words.Computer may be higher;but within 10sec(which is considered to be the weight) if you type the word Mode you can score higher than typing the word Computer within 10Sec(which could be typed only 2 times). This generally finds the individual who has the ability to aim for highest cumulative points.

Example:

Words = {Computer,Laptop,Mode,Sick}                                  
Point = {8,6,4,4} Points are length of the words  
Time  = {Depends and is quite random }
